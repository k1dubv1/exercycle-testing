Key:
x = complete
- = Todo
/ = Removed/Changed
N = Not to implement
*r = to research (somewhat in depth research)


General tests

/ has buttons -> integrated into redirect
x buttons in home page redirect to form pages
x buttons in form pages redirect to calculation page


Various inputs to check

x individual per day >7
N clicking up and down inside table -> unable to access arrow buttons?
/ arrow keys
/ enter button
x negative
x decimals
N whole numbers -> redundant with decimals
x scientific format
N negative scientific -> redundant as negative is not valid
x leading 0s
x empty input
x large negative
x lots of leading 0s


Calculations - check table + message

x single input updated
x multiple values inputted
x > 30 points per individual
x contains empty fields

  Boundary tests
  x 0
  x <30
  x >30
  x =30
  x <<30


GENERAL TODO
x implement a before method that visits the page before each test *r
x constant formatting -> Prettier
x implement constants = improved code clarity/readability *r
x iterate tests = shorter code files -> improved clarity/readability *r
/ separate files for individual, multiple? -> separate for input as well
x split tests into each type -> general, input, calculation
x constants file -> reduce lines at start of file, many test files access the same constants *r
/ links to site forms -> not needed, hyperlinks make README messy
x move site links to constants
x research Cypress "disabled" element fail *r
x change constants so that they fall under the same constant -> avoid exporting/importing multiple constants
x add comments before each set of tests (before describe)
x iterate multiple member tests -> they test the same calculations (boundary)
x change for loops to forEach -> nested loops hard to read, improve general readability *r
x research how to do arrow key inputs/click form arrows *r
x write report


(ignore key)
Notes
**SET REPO PUBLIC FOR VISIBILITY
- button 5+ only allows 5 people -> suggestion = implement instructions for what to do for other members
- household != individual points in calculation page
- household incorrect when sum of individual points > 100 -> stops at 100
- can use arrow keys inside form
- enter key proceeds to calculate page from any part of the form, only when clicked inside form -> intended? -> maybe test for next page
- arrow keys/clicking up and down can go past 7, below 0
- negative numbers are valid inputs
- scientific numbers as an answer shown
- scientific numbers can be inputted
- scientific numbers can inputted up to -1.0E+309
- scientific numbers larger than -1.0E+309 and decimals have a popup when "Work it out!" pressed
- tip for negative decimals show incorrect valid numbers
- blank input allowed

- Cypress tests fail randomly, element "disabled" *r
  - don't touch, fixes will allow incorrect access of elements to pass.
  - ignore
